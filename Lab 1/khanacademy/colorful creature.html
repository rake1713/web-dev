    The <em>Penguin</em> is awesome because <strong>it is a flightless bird that has adapted to become a master of the ocean.</strong><br>
    While they may look clumsy on land, they can <em>fly underwater</em> at speeds of up to 22 miles per hour.<br>
    Their famous "tuxedo" look is actually <strong>countershading</strong>, a clever form of camouflage that hides them from predators above and below.<br>
    Some species, like the Emperor Penguin, <em>endure the harshest winters on Earth</em> to protect their young, proving they are <strong>incredibly resilient creatures.</strong>
